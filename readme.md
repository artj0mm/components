### This is code parts (Vue.js), based by data from api project
- - -

This is improvement by contracts, where in all contracts folder has been two forms, store and edit.
In result we have one form by one contract, where if contract 'id' exist data will update,
else in DB stored new contract. This code can be improved more, but time was limited for this task.

Also look common and adapters folder. Component Datepicker.vue used in contract form

Code in file app.js shown for example, some code parts has been deleted.
